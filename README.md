## Overview

Music genre classification is a classic problem in machine learning and can have applications in recommendation systems and music analysis. This project demonstrates how to use supervised machine learning techniques, specifically the Decision Tree model, to classify music tracks into different genres based on their audio features.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis, machine learning, and scripting.
- **Pandas**: A versatile data manipulation library for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library that provides tools for predictive data analysis, including the Decision Tree algorithm.
- **Matplotlib**: A powerful visualization library for creating static, interactive, and dynamic visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: A high-level interface to Matplotlib for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains audio features of music tracks, such as tempo, rhythm, and spectral features, along with their corresponding genre labels. The data is available in a CSV format and can be accessed in the `data` directory.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Music-Machine-learning.git
